THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A TOMCAT BUT HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A
TOMDOG. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION OF OUR TIME, AND
UNFORTUNATELY ONE THAT MAY NEVER BE ANSWERED BY MODERN SCIENCE.
THE DEFINITION OF TOMCAT IS A MALE CAT, YET THE NAME FOR A MALE
DOG IS MAX. WAIT NO. THE NAME FOR A MALE DOG IS JUST DOG.
REGARDLESS, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE WERE TO COMBINE A MALE DOG
WITH A TOMCAT. PERHAPS WE END UP WITH A DOG THAT VARIES OUR
FLAGS, LIKE THIS ONE RTCP{SHOULD,FL5G4,B3,ST1CKY,OR,N0T}
